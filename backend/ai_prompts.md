Which rust backend framework is more suitable for a simple task CRUD application.

What is this npx @rocket/create@latest as i see is some kind of frontend solution but there is no rust code there i expected this to create entire full-stack app with backend and frontend.

Explain how Rocket framework works is it MVC Pattern or ?

Are there any specification on Rust's Rocket framework. Things i need to know about lifetimes, borrowing, and other stuff ? Introduce me to the ecosystem.

Can you show me how a project structure for Rocket project should look.(not with an image show me text) I want to use MVC design pattern. First create for me a visualization of project structure with explanations how to structure my modules and where to put my code. Then i want explanation about does it have cons using MVC desing pattern in Rocket ?

What other design pattern will be better for implementing simple Crud application

Do rust have ORM features because i am working on Rocket framework and i am wondering should i use raw SQL queries or i can simplify it using Orm

i have never used ORM in Rust before i hav experience in python ORM only. Suggest me the most easy to pickup ORM tool in Rust 

How in rust rocket framework the module system works. For example in pure rust i use lib.rs and i use the other modules by the package name with mod.rs file inside. But in rocket i have created structure like src/models/task_model.rs, src/routes/routes.rs and so on.
