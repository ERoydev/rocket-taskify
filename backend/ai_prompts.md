Which rust backend framework is more suitable for a simple task CRUD application.


What is this npx @rocket/create@latest as i see is some kind of frontend solution but there is no rust code there i expected this to create entire full-stack app with backend and frontend.


Explain how Rocket framework works is it MVC Pattern or ?


Are there any specification on Rust's Rocket framework. Things i need to know about lifetimes, borrowing, and other stuff ? Introduce me to the ecosystem.


Can you show me how a project structure for Rocket project should look.(not with an image show me text) I want to use MVC design pattern. First create for me a visualization of project structure with explanations how to structure my modules and where to put my code. Then i want explanation about does it have cons using MVC desing pattern in Rocket ?


What other design pattern will be better for implementing simple Crud application


Do rust have ORM features because i am working on Rocket framework and i am wondering should i use raw SQL queries or i can simplify it using Orm


i have never used ORM in Rust before i hav experience in python ORM only. Suggest me the most easy to pickup ORM tool in Rust 


How in rust rocket framework the module system works. For example in pure rust i use lib.rs and i use the other modules by the package name with mod.rs file inside. But in rocket i have created structure like src/models/task_model.rs, src/routes/routes.rs and so on.


Guide me how to work with seaOrm in Rust Rocket framework from connection setting to GET, POST request


Help me understand how migration works in seaOrm. In my case Migration created some Post{} entity for me but i need different entity i have changed it in entity folder how to work efficienlty with migrations. (Restart with new migration, Reverse..)


I WANT to remove all my migrations made and clean everything


I just deleted the folder migrations from my project now start clean and explain. I know conceptually what are migrations i need to understand the commands that are used in seaOrm to handle them. So first i need command to init the migration with my current entities that i have. 


i have migrated my migration to the db. In my entity i have defined my model with many fields but in the db i see my Task table have only 3 fields like its using different entity


But is there a way this to happen automatically. I mean when i have in src/entity/task.rs some defined model when i migrate it in the migration to have every col defined because i could rewrite the migration file but that is not optimal in the long run when i create many models


Yes but in migration i have this errorr
[E0599]: no variant or associated item named is_completed found for enum Task in the current scope
  --> src\m20250204_160342_create_tasks_table.rs:19:47
   |
19 |                     .col(ColumnDef::new(Task::is_completed).boolean().not_null().default(false))
   |                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^ variant or associated item not found in Task
...


But it works like that i am supposed to create my migration code in hand and then use it to generate entity is that right


Okay after i have configured my db connection in seaORM on Rocket framework how interact with it in GET or POST request 


i have setup file for db taken from here https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-tutorial/ch02-02-connect-to-database.html
It has logic to create if not exists, drop if exists, and create after it was dropped. This is cause my current database tables created from migration to dissappear. How i can implement command to migrate things up after database is recreated, so my migration files will create the tables


I cannot import Migrator to migrate programatically. As i see in docs i should use use migration::{Migrator, MigrationTrait}; But when i use it recieve unresolved import migration
use of undeclared crate or module migration error


I fixed it can you show me how to use it in function that does not return Result or Option


&db passed in migrator::up() have this error 
the trait bound &sea_orm::DatabaseConnection: IntoSchemaManagerConnection<'_> is not satisfied
the following other types implement trait IntoSchemaManagerConnection<'c>:
  &'c migration::sea_orm::DatabaseConnection
  &'c migration::sea_orm::DatabaseTransaction
  SchemaManagerConnection<'c>rustcClick for full compiler diagnostic

error: failed to remove file C:\ProgrammingStuff\Rust\rocket-taskify\backend\target\debug\rust-rocket-tasker.exe
Caused by:
  Access is denied. (os error 5)
What is this error i see it for the first time


Now explain to me for seaOrm how i use it in my API Endpoints to create records in my table


This is from seaORM TaskEntity::find().all(db).await. I wonder what kind of data this function chain returns. Lets say that each object looks like that {"name": "Emil", "age": "24"}. Don't give me code just give me visualization of how it looks so i can understand how to return the full data from the Api.


Okay my rust model is from entities it does not have serialize macros on it, so is it good approach to create something like Interface struct for example Task{} that will be responsible to serialize. Or this is not the widely used approach


Interesting if i put macro on the motel inside my Entity folder which corresponds to my database table it works but with my own TaskDTO doesn't work. And when i try to use this TaskDTO as a returning argument i have some error because the actuall result from find().all().await.unwrap() .. is <Vec<Model> not <Vec<TaskDTO>> first explain how i can fix this error. Second what is the purpose of craating my own TaskDTO interface when it works without it just fine.


Ahaa so this TaskDTO can fix a problem with me for date. Because i am using unix_timestamp so with that i can impl a function that converts this unix timestamp into normal date format which i can send to frontend ready for visualization


Can u show me how a test cases should look for API on rust rocket framework


Give me rust implemenatiton of converting Unix-Timestamp into normal format date like dd-mm-yy i need simpler implementation


Is it good approach to keep both converted due_date into String and the unix_timestamp in another property since i want to make bussiness logic for example the most closes date should have higher priority 


Can guide me for some kind of approach to name my test functions in rust lets say i want to test get__tasks() and create_tasks() give me some naming concept to follow along


When i run cargo test i dont see any prints on the console is there a way to see them


When i have test with this
let req = client.get("/tasks"); i recieve that i have no matchin routes for /tasks. Which is not true do i need to provide full adress like http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks?


If i use seaORM should i include db setup in the tests like i do in my main.rs


Okay i have one problem with my tests in my test i need to establish_connection with DB with seaORM and create State with .manage(db) on my rocket::build() program initialization. The problem is that i need to do the same step for 5 tests which are going to run can i do this once and use it in every test


Yes this worked but the problem still persist my problem is not for code repeating, but the way that i will create brand new initialization on every function with let rocket = rocket_with_db();. Can i avoid that or there is no sense in avoiding it. Since there is paradigm that every test should be separate and simplified. Is it good approach to keep it like that so my tests are going to be slower but keep the paradigm

use sea_orm::{DatabaseBackend, MockDatabase, Transaction,};
this code is from documentation FROM seaORM i dont understand why MockDatabase does not exists when i try to import it


Listen to me now i am working on tests/api_tests.rs on integration tests. I have a problem with fake DB and i want to kind of mock my DB to test my API functions 


https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/blob/master/examples/testing/src/async_required.rs
This is the Rocket example of how i should test can you guide me with this example how to test my API point for example for retrieving all tasks. In my original API points i use SeaORM with postgres but i wonder how to test it using mock DB data


Okay from the testing case i got a response which is this code
let response = client.get("/tasks").dispatch().await;
i wonder how from this response i can get the data so i can check fields and so on should i deserialize ? give me ideas


deserialization has failed and my code panicked .expect("valid JSON response"); it looks like response.into_json() is giving me invalid json and i cannot deserialize it how to debug and inspect this error


In my testing. I have case that is going to catch error how to catch error


In my testing. I have case that is going to catch error how to catch error. For example i want to cause this error by using db instance that is not working. So for example i use rocket in my clien where i pass rocket without .manage() state for DB is this good test ?


in rust i have implemented my own ErrorResponder from this docs https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-tutorial/ch02-03-error-handling.html check it out. And in my API point i have operation like this
let tasks = TaskEntity::find()
        .all(db)
        .await
        .map_err(Into::<ErrorResponder>::into)?; // EXPLAIN THIS
Explain how the error maps to this ErrorResponder explain what happens maybe i something with seaOrm::DbErr explain how to use these 


So using this how a test case should look 


let response = client.get("/tasks").dispatch().await;
This is returning 500 Server Error which is the behaviour i look for in the current test case how can i extract the error message from this ?


https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-tutorial/ch02-03-error-handling.html for this code i want to implement my custom logic for time for example when i have Server Error 500 to put my custom message there. In this ErrorResponder what i need to change to create this type mapping when it recieve some error like 500 Server error to return my own message


In my testing case now i task post 
let response = client.post("/tasks").dispatch().await; Here the APi uses macro where it expects data=<new_task> meaning i need to pass NewTask Object which i have created i dont know how to pass with this


My task insertion is returning
InsertResult<ActiveModel> which i need to convert to my TaskDTO to return as json how to achieve this


 let mock_tasks = mock_tasks_setup();
        // Create a mock database with the prepared data
        let db: DatabaseConnection = mock_db_setup(mock_tasks);
        // Build the Rocket instance with the mocked database
        let rocket = rocket(db);
I want to check in my test case my db when i have created new task for example but how to approach such testing. When u give me code snippets dont give me side code please


I need to implement business logic for priority i work with unix-timestamp. I have function that take now timestamp in the moment of function call() and there i will have passed argument with task.due_time. Guide me how to structure my priority system meaning if its very close i will have priority String that will be Imediate or something like that. Then if its more longer it will be High then Medium then Low. I need this time system to structure the logic


let priority;
    if new_task.is_completed {
        priority = "Low".to_string();
    } else if new_task.is_critical {
        priority = "Immediate".to_string();
    } else {
        priority = calculate_priority_based_on_due_date(new_task.due_date);
    }
can i turn this into a match expression


Can you show me in rocket framework how i can write simple tests to test functions


i hasve test/api_test.rs where i test APIS how to name a module which is going to test business logic


In rust how to order by rules. Can i create some kind of rule to order strings because i have like 'low', 'high' and so on and i want based on this rules to order objects ascending or descending. I have like objects with string value. 


this is seaOrm
.order_by_desc(TaskPriorityLevel::priority_order(task::Column::Priority))
I want to do something like that because task::Column::Priority is 'low' or 'high' and i want to use function where i match value and return 1 or 2 or 3 in order to sort


In postgres I builded my SQL Case and in the end i have order it successfully. The only thing i forgot was how to remove now that field that was used for ordering so i can return my clean data


Okay can i do something to simplify my RAW SQL inside my API POINT because i dont like it staying there. What is used in those scenarios ?


I have implemented my SQL i have one other problem since my API is
#[get("/tasks?<sort>")]
If i dont get sort thats good i have my solution. But if i take sort how to implement the logic without introducing another sql ?


#[get("/tasks?filter=isCompleted&value=false")]
How to do API liket hat in rust rocket 


Give me guide how to implement Async priority recalculation on the backend on rust rocket framework. Give me ideas with time set for example every 10 minutes i fetch them or other approach that is better than this.


How to calculate if my priority calculation is expensive. How to see that


I am using Rocket framework with SeaORM in Rust. I want to build a background task to update priority of my tasks. Show me how to use rocket fairings to create this.


Is on_liftoff Fairing function good? Because i need long-term background task which will have timer and every 24hours its going to update my priority field from every record from the DB on table tasks


So i use tokio with combination with on_liftoff ?


What logger is used in rust to print in console on production ?
