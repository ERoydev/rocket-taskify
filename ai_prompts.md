Which rust backend framework is more suitable for a simple task CRUD application.

What is this npx @rocket/create@latest as i see is some kind of frontend solution but there is no rust code there i expected this to create entire full-stack app with backend and frontend.

Are there any specification on Rust's Rocket framework. Things i need to know about lifetimes, borrowing, and other stuff ? Introduce me to the ecosystem.
